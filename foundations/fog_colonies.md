# Fog Colony: The Digital Divide's Frontier

<img src="../assets/fog_colony.png" width="704" />

In the heartland, life moves at a distinct pace. Isolated from the lightning speed of the digital world, rural communities watch progression elapse from a distance. Connected by a shared sense of community and reinforced by hard work and sacrifice, rural dwellers fashion solutions out of limited resources with a pragmatic spirit.

However, the rise of artificial intelligence poses a new challenge to these areas. The disruption it brings broadens the digital divide, posing a significant threat to communities ill-equipped for its relentless advance. The question stands: how can these valiant custodians of rural America stand firm against this digital storm?

The concept of "digital colonies" arises from this question, drawing parallels to the brave pioneers who ventured into the unknown and built thriving communities against all odds. Every individual provided a unique contribution crucial to the survival and growth of the colony, embodying unity and collaboration in the face of adversity.

Indeed, the historical colonies serve as an inspiring metaphor, their experiences providing valuable lessons for the digital frontier. Exactly like past pioneers, members of these "digital colonies" will contribute what they have: repurposing unused or old tech assets to address the digital divide.

These devices would form a network of 'fog' computing nodes, located wherever feasible - barns, warehouses, mills. Powered resourcefully by solar, hydroelectric, geothermal, or grid sources, and connected via digital radio, fiber, or 5G, they would form a modest computational force, a rural respondent to the city's cloud computing units. The intent? Fortify rural resilience in the face of the relentless pace of digital progress, thereby reinforcing their spirit of self-reliance with a modern touch.
